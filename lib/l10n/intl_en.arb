Turn from your fierce anger, and repent from this evil against your people. 13 Remember Abraham, Isaac and Israel your servants, to whom you have sworn by yourself, and you have said to them: I will multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven; and I will give to your descendants all this land of which I have spoken, and they shall inherit it forever.",

And Saul set him over men of war, and he was acceptable in the eyes of all the people, and in the eyes of Saul's servants. 6 It happened that when they returned, when David returned from killing the Philistine, the women of all the cities of Israel came out singing and dancing, to receive King Saul, with tambourines, with songs of joy and with musical instruments. 7 And the women who danced sang, and said, Saul smote his thousands, and David his ten thousands. 8 And Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him, and he said: They gave David ten thousands, and thousands to me; he lacks only the kingdom. 9 And from that day Saul did not look kindly on David. 10 It happened the next day, that an evil spirit from God took Saul, and he raved in the middle of the house. David played with his hand like the other days; and Saul had the spear in his hand. 11 And Saul threw the spear, saying, I will nail David to the wall. But David evaded him twice. 12 But Saul was afraid of David, because the Lord was with him, and had departed from Saul; 13 Therefore Saul removed him from himself, and made him commander of a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people. 14 And David conducted himself prudently in all his affairs, and the Lord was with him. 15 And when Saul saw that he behaved so prudently, he was afraid of him. 16 But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.",
